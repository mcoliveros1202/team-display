  ## Description
    This project takes information about team members, either the manager, engineer, or intern, and displays it on a webpage. The webpage should have each team member's name, their id number, a live link to their email address, the manager's office number, the engineer's github username that links to their github, and the intern's school name.

  ## Installation
    There is no installation process.

  ## Usage
    To use this application, run the program through Node and fill out the questions for each team member that is to be added. Once all team members have been added, select 'No more!' to generate the webpage. This is useful for a project management scenario where one may wish to have all members of a team and their information displayed in one location.
